              Hey,<br><br>
              Well… this is me again. I know you’ll probably think I’m crazy, immature, stupid — maybe even a little too chipku. But this is who I am, and this is my year‑end message to you. Most likely, my last one.
              <br><br>
              First of all, I’m sorry. For all the times I hurt you, for the moments I chose myself over us, for being selfish when I should have been more understanding. I did care for you — deeply. You weren’t just my friend, you were family to me, and losing you felt like losing a part of myself.
              <br><br>
              I knew it was over on 18 August. I knew I had messed up back then. Still, I waited four months, hoping I could try one last time — not to force anything, just to see if there was still something worth saving. It didn’t work, and I’ve made my peace with that now.
              <br><br>
              I want you to know this: you were the most beautiful thing that happened to me. The way you cared, the love you gave, the time you shared — those memories were the best time of my life. I will cherish them forever. Thank you for standing by me, for listening to me, for being there when you didn’t have to be.
              <br><br>
              I truly hope you succeed in life and live it exactly the way you want to. May Allah grant you everything your heart desires, in ways better than you ever imagined.
              <br><br>
              I never wanted to give up on you or on our friendship. But I don’t have it in me anymore to try to revive something that no longer wants to breathe. So this is me letting go — quietly, respectfully.
              <br><br>
              I’m done trying. I’m signing off from annoying you. I won’t text, I won’t disturb your peace anymore. But in my heart, you will always be my best friend — always a part of my family.
              <br><br>
              Take care.
            </p>
